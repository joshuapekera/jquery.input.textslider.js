Oh boy. You're very own text input slider!

After taking some inspiration from the Adobe Creative Suite and wanting a similar thing
on the web, we built `jquery.input.textslider.js`. It gives you a new great way to
work with simple text inputs.

## Usage

```javascript
$(function () {
  $('[data-textslider]').textslider();
});
```

And you're done.

The options don't work yet, but they will be `precision` and `ratio`. More soon.

## About

jquery.input.textslider.js was originally developed for [LayerVault](http://layervault.com) by [Kelly Sutton](http://kellysutton.com).

You can see more projects from LayerVault in the [LayerVault Cosmos](http://cosmos.layervault.com).
